# Sticky

Sticky is a small game I made. The goal of the game is to move a cube through multiple mazes without touching the walls and avoiding other obstacles. Moving the cube is done by using the W, A, S, and D keys.

Currently, the game is only available for Windows PCs, but you can run it on MacOS and Linux using [WINE](https://www.winehq.org/).

# Planned features

 - Ability to change default controls
 - More levels
 - Level editor and custom level support (maybe)
 - Support for other platforms (specifically Linux and MacOS)
