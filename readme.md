# Sticky

Sticky is a small game I made. The goal of the game is to move a cube through multiple mazes without touching the walls and avoiding other obstacles. Moving the cube is done by using the W, A, S, and D keys.

Currently, the game is only available for Windows PCs, but you can run it on MacOS and Linux using [WINE](https://www.winehq.org/).

# Planned changes

 - Add ability to change default controls
 - Add level editor and custom level support (maybe)
 - Add support for other platforms (specifically Linux and MacOS)
 - Add ability to view changelogs in-game
 - Add more levels
 - Add automatic update checker
 - Add In-game feedback button
 - Switch to Unreal Engine (Most likely won't happen because that will require rewriting the game from the ground up.)
