# Sticky

Sticky is a small game I made. The goal of the game is to move a cube through multiple mazes without touching the walls and avoiding other obstacles. Moving the cube is done by using the W, A, S, and D keys.

Currently, the game is only available for Windows and Linux, but you can try to run it on MacOS using [WINE](https://www.winehq.org/).

# Planned updates/features

 - Add support for MacOS
 - Add more levels
 - Add automatic update checker
 - Add ability to import/export save files
 - Add support for multiple save files.
